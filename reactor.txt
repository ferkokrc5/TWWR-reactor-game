Systems:
Coolant system - pumps, pipes. manages the flow of coolant into the reactor. error: reactor temperature starts to rise  (energy dependent)
pump broken 1211
pipes blown (coolant pipe integrity)1222
pipes damaged (coolant pipe integrity)1223
Fuel system - fuel input. manages the flow of fuel into the reactor. error: reactor slows down, eventual shutdown
fuel burnout (change fuel)1314
wrong material inserted Fatal substance in reactor (meltdown)1357
Network system - terminals, control panels. connects all terminals into the computer core. error: system lockout (energy dependent)
network error 2334
Energy system - backup generators. backup generators to power the systems during a blackout. error: no backup energy source
generator malfunction 3447
Reactor core - reactor, control rods. turns water into steam.
reactor meltdown 6669
tritium pileup 7802
reactor poisoning 3068
Conversion system - turbines, pipes. turns steam into energy. error: energy flow stops from the reactor (reactor dependent)
pipes damaged (steam pipe integrity) 1589
pipes blown (steam pipe integrity)1599
turbines damaged (turbine integrity) 1405
turbines broken (turbine integrity)1435
